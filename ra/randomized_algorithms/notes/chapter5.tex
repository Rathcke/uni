\section{The Probabilistic Method}
\subsection{Overview of the method}
\label{sub:Overview of the method}
The two reccurent ideas:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Any random var assumes at least one value no smaller than the expected and at least 1 value that is not greater than the expected.
  \item If an object chosen randomly from a universe satisfies a property with positive probability, then there must be an object in the universe that satisfies that property.
\end{enumerate}
The method generally consists of 2 stages: First, we design a "thought experiment" in which a random process plays a role, e.g. assigning $+1$ or $-1$ indepedently and equiprobably to the elements of $b$ in the set-balancing problem. Second, we analyze the random exp and draw conclusion indepently from the exp.\\

\textbf{Thm 5.1: } For any undigraph $G$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, there is a partition of the vertex set $V$ into $A$ and $B$ such that
$$
  |\{(u,v)\in E | u\in A \land v \in B\}|\geq m/2
$$\textbf{Pf: } Consider assigning each vertex of $G$ to $A$ and $B$ indep and equiprob. For an $(u,v)$ the prob that endpoints will end up in diff sets is $1/2$. Using LOE, for the $m$ edges, the expected number of edges with endpoints in diff sets is $m/2$.\\

\subsection{Maximum Satisfiability}
\label{sub:Maximum Satisfiability}
Focus on satisfiability problem. For $m$ clause in CNF over $n$ variables, we seek an assignment of the variables st. all clauses are satisfied. MAX-SAT is the problem of maximizing the number of satisfied clauses. MAX-SAT is NP-hard but the following probabilistic argument shows that for any $m$ clauses there is an assignment of variables st. at least $m/2$ clauses are satisfied.
\textbf{Thm 5.2: } For any set of $m$ clauses, there is a truth assignment for the variables that satisfies at least $m/2$ clauses.
THIS IS SHIT
\subsection{Expanding Graphs}
\label{sub:Expanding Graphs}
We define an expanding graph as a graph in which the number of neighbours of any set of vertices $S$ is larger than some positive constant multiple of $|S|$. An OR-concentrator is a special expanding graph.
