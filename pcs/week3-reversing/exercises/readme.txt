  |    Week 3: Reversing          |

  '-------------------------------'

This week there is only one exercise. You must reverse engineer the program
'mud' and figure out what and how it does it.

Try to answer the following questions:
    - Which file format is it?
    - What does the program do (draw a picture -- literally)?
    - What are the different ways the program can end?
    - How do you get it to end in each way?

Have fun!
