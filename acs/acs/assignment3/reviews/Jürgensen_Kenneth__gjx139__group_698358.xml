    <question1>
      <title>Description of implementation and tests</title>
      <q1a>
        <text>
          Does the solution contain a clear description of the approach
          used to achieve before-or-after atomicity?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q1a>
      <q1b>
        <text>
          Provide comments on any aspects that you found unclear in the
          description of the approach to achieve before-or-after atomicity
        </text>
        <answer>
          No comments, considers the possibility of exception being thrown and explains when the locking happens.
        </answer>
      </q1b>
      <q1c>
        <text>
          Does the code include implementations of Tests 1 and 2 of the
          assignment description as well as of at least another two test
          cases?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q1c>
      <q1d-i>
        <text>
          Is it tested that the final state resulting from concurrent
          execution
          is correct in that it respects invariants designed in the test?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q1d-i>
      <q1d-ii>
        <text>
          Is it tested that intermediate reads of the state during concurrent
          execution respect invariants designed in the test, so that it is
          arguable that these intermediate states could be found in an
          equivalent serial schedule?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q1d-ii>
      <q1e>
        <text>
          Provide comments on why you found that any portions of the test
          descriptions were unclear according to the criteria, and suggestions for
          improvement
        </text>
        <answer>
          We were only able to run the tests locally, despite the fact that the group states
          that they implemented them over HTTP.
          - Regarding test1:
            The client that keeps buying and restocking bookcopies runs on a fixed number
            of iterations. There is a risk that this will finish way before the other client
            begins taking snapshots. The snapshot client should invoke some sort of interrupt
            to notify the buy/restock client it should stop.
          - Regarding test4:
            Some more meaningful assertions could have been made based on the expected outcome
            of the test
          Generally the 'self made' tests only tests throughput when reading and writing. Testing
          for e.g. deadlocks or other properties could perhaps have been more interesting.

    <question2>
      <title>Correctness argument for locking protocol</title>
      <q2a>
        <text>
          Is the variant of 2PL to which equivalence is being established in
          the correctness argument clearly identified (e.g., conservative, strict,
          conservative strict)?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q2a>
      <q2b>
        <text>
          Is there a sound argumentation of why the steps in the locking
          protocol designed correspond to steps taken in the chosen variant
          of 2PL?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q2b>
      <q2c>
        <text>
          Is there an argument for the need to take into account predicate
          reads, with appropriate justification?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q2c>
      <q2d>
        <text>
          Is there an argument for the need to take into account predicate
          reads, with appropriate justification?
        </text>
        <answer>No comment. Predicate reads are discussed.</answer>
      </q2d>
    </question2>

    <question3>
      <title>Deadlocks</title>
      <q3a>
        <text>
          Does the solution contain a correct argument for why deadlocks can
          occur in the locking protocol or why deadlocks cannot occur?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q3a>
      <q3b>
        <text>
          Provide comments on how the argument provided with respect to
          deadlocks could be improved
        </text>
        <answer>Nothing to add again.</answer>
      </q3b>
    </question3>

    <question4>
      <title>Reflections on scalability</title>
      <q4a>
        <text>
          Is there a sound argument about the scalability limits of the
          concurrent implementation provided?
        </text>
        <answer>NO</answer>
      </q4a>
      <q4b>
        <text>
          Provide comments on how the reflections on scalability could be
          improved
        </text>
        <answer>You only address scalability issues with increasing number of client. You should also discuss the behavior when there are more hardware resources available.</answer>
      </q4b>
    </question4>

    <question5>
      <title>Argumentation on decisions made for performance</title>
      <q5a>
        <text>
          Is there a sound argument in the solution about the trade-off between
          locking overhead and concurrency?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q5a>
      <q5b>
        <text>
          Provide comments on how the argument about performance trade-offs in
          the locking protocol could be improved
        </text>
        <answer>
          All criteria for a 'YES' have been provided, but the answers are VERY brief.
          Could have been described a little better, but will mark it as satisfacory.
