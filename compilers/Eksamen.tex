\subsection*{Task 1 - Grammar transformation for LL(1)}
We have the following grammar $G_{T_{UP}}$ with the 4 terminals: id ( ) ,
\begin{align*}
S &\rightarrow id \\
S &\rightarrow (\:T\:) \\
T &\rightarrow S\:,\:T \\
T &\rightarrow S
\end{align*}
for tuple expressions for LL(1) parsing.
\subsubsection*{a}
Give a short reason why this grammar is not LL(1), and transform the grammar (using a well-known transformation) to obtain a grammar $G'_{T_{UP}}$ suitable for LL(1) parsing.\\
\\
To make the grammer LL(1), we want to
\begin{enumerate}
\item Eliminate ambiguity
\item Eliminate left-recursion
\item Perform left factorisation where required
\end{enumerate}
Since the two productions for $T$ begins with the same symbol, this means they have overlapping \textit{FIRST} sets and is not LL(1). Therefore we need to left-factor $T$ by making the a simple production with the same common prefix, $S$ and creating another nonterminal, so we get the following grammar $G'_{T_{UP}}$
\begin{align*}
S &\rightarrow id \\
S &\rightarrow (\:T\:) \\
T &\rightarrow S\:R \\
R &\rightarrow \:,\:T \\
R &\rightarrow \varepsilon
\end{align*}

\subsubsection*{b}
For $G'_{T_{UP}}$, determine \textit{FIRST} sets for all right-hand sides.\\
\\
We calculate these through fixed-point iteration using the rules from \textbf{Algorithm 2.5}\footnote{Torben Ægidius Mogensen, Introduction to Compiler Design, page 55}.  \\
\\
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c}
\hline 
Right-hand side & Initialisation & Iteration 1 & Iteration 2 & Iteration 3 \\ 
\hline 
id & $\emptyset$ & \{id\} & \{id\} & \{id\} \\ 
( T ) & $\emptyset$ & \{$\:$($\:$\} & \{$\:$($\:$\} & \{$\:$($\:$\} \\ 
S R & $\emptyset$ & $\emptyset$ & \{id, ($\:$\} & \{id, ($\:$\} \\ 
, T & $\emptyset$ & \{$\:$,$\:$\} & \{$\:$,$\:$\} & \{$\:$,$\:$\} \\  
$\varepsilon$ & $\emptyset$ & $\emptyset$ & $\emptyset$ & $\emptyset$ \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular} \\
\\
And then we reach a fixed point.\\
So we have the following \textit{FIRST} sets
\begin{align*}
FIRST(id) &=\{id\} \\
FIRST(\:(\:T\:)\:) &= \{\:(\:\} \\
FIRST(S\:R) &= \{id,\:(\:\} \\
FIRST(,\:T) &= \{\:,\:\} \\
FIRST(\varepsilon) &= \emptyset
\end{align*}

\subsubsection*{c}
Add a start production $S' \rightarrow S\$$ and determine \textit{FOLLOW} sets for all nonterminals.\\
\\
This yields the grammar
\begin{align*}
S' &\rightarrow S\$ \\
S &\rightarrow id \\
S &\rightarrow (\:T\:) \\
T &\rightarrow S\:R \\
R &\rightarrow \:,\:T \\
R &\rightarrow \varepsilon
\end{align*}
To calculate the \textit{FOLLOW} sets, we follow an algorithm\footnote{Torben Ægidius Mogensen, Introduction to Compiler Design, page 59} and get the following constraints \\
\\
For the production $S' \rightarrow S\$$ we add the following constraint since '\$' is seen as a terminal and is therefore the \textit{FIRST} set of what follows $S$ but '\$' is not nullable.
\begin{align*}
\{\$\} \subseteq \{S\}
\end{align*}
For the production $S \rightarrow id$ there are no nonterminals, so no constraints are added.\\\\
For the production $S \rightarrow (\:T\:)$ we add the following constraint since ')' is the \textit{FIRST} set of what follows $T$ but is not nullable.
\begin{align*}
\{\:)\:\} \subseteq \{T\}
\end{align*}
For the production $T \rightarrow S\:R$ we make a split for each occurence. Looking at the nonterminal $S$ we get the constraint
$$ \{\:,\:\} \subseteq \{S\} $$
since it is the \textit{FIRST} set of $R$. Furthermore, since $R$ is nullable, we add the following constraint
$$ \{T\} \subseteq \{S\} $$
Now looking at $R$ there is nothing in the \textit{FIRST} set, so no constraint is added. However, that nothing follows means that it is nullable, so we add the constraint
$$ \{T\} \subseteq \{R\} $$
For the production $R \rightarrow \:,\:T$ we get nothing in the \textit{FIRST} set for what follows $T$ meaning it is the same case as above so we add the following constraint
$$ \{R\} \subseteq \{T\} $$
For the last production $R \rightarrow \varepsilon$ there are no nonterminals, so no constraints are added.\\
\\
Now we need to solve these constraints. For each constraint on the form $terminal \subseteq nonterminal$ we put those into $FOLLOW(nonterminal)$ so we get
\begin{align*}
FOLLOW(S) &= \{\$,\:','\} \\ 
FOLLOW(T) &= \{\:)\:\} \\
FOLLOW(R) &= \emptyset
\end{align*}
Now for each constraint on the form $nonterminal \subseteq nonterminal$ we add the content from the \textit{FOLLOW} set of the first nonterminal to the second until a fixed point is reached and we get
\begin{align*}
FOLLOW(S) &= \{\$,\:',',\:)\} \\
FOLLOW(T) &= \{\:)\:\} \\
FOLLOW(R) &= \{\:)\:\}
\end{align*}
Whereas a fixed point is reached and we have our \textit{FOLLOW} sets.

\subsubsection*{d}
Determine the look-ahead sets for all productions and point out that $G'_{T_{UP}}$ is LL(1).\\
\\
Having calculated \textit{FIRST} and \textit{FOLLOW} we can use the following rules to determine look-ahead (LA) sets.
$$
LA(X\rightarrow \alpha) = \left\{ \begin{array}{rl}
FIRST(\alpha) \cup FOLLOW(X) &\mbox{ if NULLABLE(X)} \\
FIRST(\alpha) &\mbox{ otherwise}
\end{array} \right.
$$
So we get the following look ahead sets (disregarding the added start production) \\
$$LA(S \rightarrow id) = \{id\}$$
Since the right hand side is not nullable.
$$LA(S \rightarrow (\:T\:)) = \{\:(\:\}$$
Since the right hand side is not nullable.
$$LA(T \rightarrow S\:R) = \{id,\:(\}$$
Since the right hand side is not nullable.
$$LA(R \rightarrow \:,\:T) = \{\:,\:\}$$
Since the right hand side is not nullable.
$$LA(R \rightarrow \varepsilon) = \{\:)\:\}$$
Since the right hand side is nullable.\\
\\
Since for each nonterminal $X$ in the grammar, the look ahead sets for each production for this nonterminal are disjoint, it means the grammar is LL(1).

\subsection*{Task 2 - Extend the equality operation in Paladim to work on arrays}
\subsubsection*{Major Changes}
Changes were done to the "Compiler.sml" and "Type.sml".\\
\\
\textbf{Type:} Nothing was added to this file, but the following part was removed
\begingroup
    \fontsize{9pt}{12pt}\selectfont
    \begin{verbatim}  
val _ = case tp1 of
            Array _ => raise Error("in type check equal, first expression "^
                                   pp_exp e1_new^ " is an array (of type) "^
                                   pp_type tp1^" at ", pos)
          | _ => ()
    \end{verbatim}  
\endgroup
Since this was the restraint in type-checking for arrays for the equality operation. The code above would check for both type and rank and raise and error if these did not match, leaving only shape and elements to be compared.\\
\\
\textbf{Compiler:} 
\subsubsection*{Tests}
Tests for Task 2 was done with the "ArrayEqual.pal" seen in Annex 1. The tests included creating a multi dimensional array and inserting some data (either char, bool, or ints) and seeing if it provided the correct answer, which all the in the test program does.\\
It was tested with data for all index in the multidimensional array and it was tested with some index left untouched, for which it provided the right answer.\\
It was also tested with a simple array for all the basic types, returning the right answer as well.\\
\\
There would be raised errors if types got mixed in the arrays, if empty arrays were created or if shapes did not match, as was intended.\\
The program was also inspected using the MARS simulator to see if it acted as thought. \\
No immediate errors were found.
