Think outloud testing

The purpose of this think outloud test is to check that navigation through our android appliaction is logical to a new user.

The test will be done with a penn and paper mock up, and will ask the user to navigate to a book using both the catagories and the search tool.

While the test is ungoing the user will be asked the effect of repetitions when navigating through the application.
