We very much agreed with the premis of the article, that a good programmer is one that has a thorough understanding of the chooses made when developing a program. The articles position on documentation however is not one that we condole, well documented work can and should be a enough do modification I existing program. The savings done by this should rectify the potential fallacies with the orginal program theory. The book also stretches the point of a well documented product as discussed at length in our previous paper.
