Since we do not have a functional application as of this moment, no actual tests have been performed yet. We plan to, as soon as possible, to construct a pen and paper version of our desired interface, which we will use for a series of think-out-loud tests, to determine the usability of our design. These tests will be performed on people, who will have no relation to neither us nor the project, but rather random people who happen to agree to be subjected to them.\\
We will, as soon as we get a working dummy-prototype up  and running, perform the same tests once more in order to get the most satisfying results. We have deemed this appropriate as the Android Application market, along with our client, has a wide range of users.\\
A JUnit testsuite is yet to be established, but is still a work in progress in the process of testing the backend of our Java code.
