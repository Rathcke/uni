Black-box testing
Since the last sprint, we have been performing black-box testing as soon as the individual sites were up and running, to examine the functionality of the applications current solution. Since the pages, as of now, do not consist of the most advanced code, the minor bugs found, has been solveable. This does not include the graphic layout.

Since the last commit, we have succesfully merged together the GUIs described in Figure \ref{Book information}, \ref{Categories} and \ref{Results} and in the previous papers "Version control" section.
The classes from the first commits are still merged together with the rest, although unused, we still do not know if they will come in handy. With the new content added, we are now able to navigate between pages, due to the increased functionality. Since the current version still is in the prototype state, it only contains dummy data for test purposes A clone of the repository yields the code for an application that can be run on any Android device of version 2.3 or higher, though a path for a local ADK must be provided, and some other system specific settings. Furthermore it will hold the most updated working application.
